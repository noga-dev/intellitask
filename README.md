# intellitask

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

originally wanted to use vertex ai - but no vanilla api and supabase lacks the runtimes supported by appwrite and firebase (python in this case for which vertex ai has an official sdk)

then tried dart edge functions to use with openai --  but too experimental to be useable as of yet
